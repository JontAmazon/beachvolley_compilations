Custom script that takes a beachvolley video as input, and gives different videos as output:
1. The whole video, but dead time between points trimmed away.
2. Compilations for each player (receive/attack).

Method:
1. Start script and immediately start the video (and don't pause it).
2. Watch the video and press keys when certain things happen. Different keys for:
  - points is about to start
  - point ended
  - player 1 received a serve (and is therefore about to attack)
  - player 2 received a serve
  - player 3 received a serve
  - player 4 received a serve
